## 2026-09-13 — Workforce leave / shift-change workflow

### Scope
- Pull request: #80 `Add workforce leave and shift-change requests`
- Feature branch head tested before merge: `0a3065bf064cb110cbab11a538abcb2dfa4253ca`
- Squash merge commit on `main`: `69fcc350dd8f9cb645177eb571ecef956479d34d`
- Storage remains in the existing PostgreSQL `business_state.modules.schedule` JSONB document; this phase requires no SQL migration.

### CI diagnosis and resolution
- The original PR workflow failure was isolated to the existing `Full-device cross-browser regression` gate, not the new workforce API/browser request tests.
- The captured full-device artifact showed all scoped mobile role/site Chromium cases passing; the one failure was a timeout while certifying the administrator mobile navigation state.
- No permission assertion or release gate was weakened. The exact failed regression job was rerun unchanged.
- Rerun result: preflight and regression passed, including workforce approval/request coverage, mobile role/site certification and full-device cross-browser coverage.
- PR #80 was merged only after the unchanged release gates were green.

### Production pipeline
- Main deployment workflow run: `34715840529` for exact application commit `69fcc350dd8f9cb645177eb571ecef956479d34d`.
- Isolated API load-smoke run: `34715840533` — passed 10/25/50-client smoke.
- Production result verified: preflight, regression, exact-SHA VPS deploy, health/release check and `production-ui-smoke` all completed successfully.
- Production deploy job used the existing server-side backup/rollback path before releasing the exact tested commit.

### Database safety
- No schema/data migration is introduced by PR #80.
- Before the next schema/data migration, preserve one immutable original PostgreSQL baseline dump outside normal rotating backups. Do not claim this baseline exists until it has been verified on the VPS.

### Next continuation point
1. Build attendance correction/request workflow as the next workforce slice; employee/part-time submit their own correction request, manager/admin approve or reject, and approved correction invalidates attendance approval so it must be reviewed again.
2. Then continue payroll history/export and configurable scheduling/shift rules without inventing wage rules.
3. Keep manager/admin authority distinct from employee/part-time self-service and certify desktop/mobile parity through the existing release gates.
